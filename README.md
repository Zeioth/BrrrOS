# BrrrOS
The OS that goes like brrr

## Why did you do this?
[I just did](https://i.redd.it/ho2zlmfkn2b01.png)

## Who is this for

* Experienced Arch/Manjaro users who want to get ideas for their own system.
* People who want to have all the important system configs on ~/.config to avoid
  breakage on updates.
* People too fucking lazy to write their own installer. → Yes I'm looking at you

## INSTALLATION

Run archinstall to install arch, choose sway, and then just

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:Zeioth/BrrrOS.git && cd BrrrOS &&  /
installer.sh
```

  In the TUI installer, choose what to install

``` text
1) Software installer   →  Base packages from the official arch repos.
2) Settings applier     →  You can accept only the ones you want!
3) AUR installer        →  you can accept only the ones your want!
```

## FEATURES

* Pure arch Linux.
* Easy to customize sway settings [tidy, follow conventions].
* Easy to customize desktop widgets.
* Tokyonight theme.
* Custom sway modes.
* Beautiful base to customize.

## KOWN BUGS

* THE CAT PHOTOS SECTION DON'T DISLPAY CAT PHOTOS → Max priority
* Modes currently use workman layout → Users probably prefer qwerty.
* Background not included → yet
* By default, still uses a few of my personal settings (6 screens and stuff) → Make it user agnostic

Please report any bug you find and I will look into tehm.
