# BrrrOS
The OS that goes like brrr

## Why did you do this?
[I don't know I just did](https://i.redd.it/ho2zlmfkn2b01.png).

## Who is this OS for

* Experienced Arch/Manjaro users who want to get ideas for their own system.
* People who want to have all the important system configs on ~/.config to avoid
  breakage on updates.
* People too fucking lazy to write their own installer. → Yes I'm looking at you

## DOWNLOAD

* Download a release from github or clone with

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:Zeioth/BrrrOS.git
    ```

## HOW TO INSTALL

Run archinstall to install arch, choose sway, and then just

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:Zeioth/BrrrOS.git && cd BrrrOS &&  /
installer.sh
```

  In the TUI installer, choose want to install

``` bash
1) Software installer   →  Base packages from the official arch repos.
2) Settings applier     →  You can accept only the ones you want!
3) AUR installer        →  you can accept only the ones your want!
```
## CAT PHOTOS EVERYONE LIKE CAT PHOTOS

## FEATURES PACKED

* Easy to customize sway settings [tidy, follow conventions].
* Easy to customize desktop widget using nwg-wrapper.
* Everything packed has the tokyonight theme applied.
  [Similar to nord, but doesn't look bleached on LCD displays].
* Custom keyboard modes [screenshot, resolution-change, tile-movement]
* HiDPI is a first class citzen here.
* Like Manjaro-Sway, but it works.

## KOWN BUGS

* THE CAT PHOTOS SECTION DON'T DISLPAY CAT PHOTOS → Max priority
* Modes currently use weird keys (workman layour) → Users probably prefer qwerty.
* We must include the background.
* By default, still uses a few of my personal settings (6 screens and stuff) → Make it user agnostic

It should be quite well polished.
Please report any bug you find and I promise I will look into it.
